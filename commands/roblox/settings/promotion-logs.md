# Promotion Logs

## Usage

This command is used to change where promotions and demotions are logged in your discord server.  
Usage:

```text
s!settings promotionlogs <channel>
```

Once this command is executed, the channel where Soldier logs promotions and demotions will be changed to the channel that was mentioned in the command.

## Permissions

Only members with `ADMINISTRATOR` permissions are able to use this command.  
Servers with the request system off are not allowed to use this command.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your server has the request system turned off, you can still log promotions and demotions by creating a channel called "\#soldier-logs".
{% endhint %}
