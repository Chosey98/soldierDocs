# Group ID

## Usage

This command is used to change the roblox group associated with your discord server.  
Usage:

```text
s!settings groupid <groupid>
```

Once this command is executed, the roblox group associated with Soldier for your discord server will change to the group that the group ID you entered is associated with.

This will also mean that you will need to request for Soldier to join your new roblox group.

## Permissions

Only members with `ADMINISTRATOR` permissions are able to use this command.
