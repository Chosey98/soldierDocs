# Ranking In Armies

To promote/demote someone, you must do the command:

```text
s!rank 
```

And the prompt will continue in the dm with these questions below:

* Please enter the username you want to promote/demote
* Please enter the rank you wish to rank the user
* What is the reason for this request?
* Are you sure you want to send this? Reply with yes/no

And then it will be sent to a channel that was decided by the owner/admin.
